  * * Author: JAMIE POPE
   
  * In this breakthrough introductory text, educators Jamie Pope and Steve Nizielski, and science writer, Alison McCook use real stories—about real people and real science—to teach the basic concepts of nutrition. Each chapter reads like Scientific American-style article, with compelling reporting and beautifully designed infographics providing a context for the scientific content. Unique chapters on timely topics (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, plant-based diets, fat- and water-soluble vitamins, dietary supplements, and the college years) exemplify the book’s thoroughly contemporary approach to nutrition science.
 


 Nutrition for Changing World is also the only textbook for the course to offer automatically graded dietary analysis activities using the USDA’s open-access SuperTracker. These exercises are in LaunchPad, a dedicated online course space that compliments the text to provide students with a fully integrated print/digital learning experience.

 For those courses that explore the micronutrients by function in the body, the first edition includes a 10-page Infographic that arranges micronutrient coverage by nutrients involved in metabolism, antioxidant function, bone health, and blood health. This rich appendix (Appendix A3) includes embedded questions for student reflection and cross-references to the vitamins and minerals chapters. The Appendix is also available in PowerPoint for instructor use.
